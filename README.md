### Description:
This project is a tool for programmers and scientists to test their AI. Our project provides a test environment for multiple artificial consciousnesses to survive in the simulated world. The AI needs to imitate human actions such as obtaining water, cutting down trees, hunting animals and avoiding predators.

### Project Management tool:
We adopt Trello-Kanban as our project management tool, and here is our link:Â

### Technology Used:
Most code is done by python with calls to the openAl gym package. JavaScript files are used for editing and adding archives. The use of c++is mainly used to improve the corresponding algorithm and improve the overall running time of the code. We also call the c-types package to achieve interactions between python and c++as well.

### Instructions:
You can install all packages by executing the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the console.

### Future Plan:
We want to develop a game based on the existing project. Our teammates are interested in this topic. We want to add more features such as improving the food chain; By this, we need to define more creatures that we do not have enough time to implement. We left it for our client to define his creatures since he demands flexibility. We also want to improve our compatibility with OpenAI, since none of us has worked with coding AI before; once we need a space to test our own AI, we will have a clearer understanding of an AI programmer's need for a testing environment.
